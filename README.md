# CutieStudio - Enhanced Video Object Segmentation and Analysis

CutieStudio is an enhanced fork of [Cutie](https://hkchengrex.github.io/Cutie), adding powerful mask analysis and visualization capabilities to the original video object segmentation framework.

## Original Work
Cutie is a video object segmentation framework by [Ho Kei Cheng](https://hkchengrex.github.io/), [Seoung Wug Oh](https://sites.google.com/view/seoungwugoh/), [Brian Price](https://www.brianpricephd.com/), [Joon-Young Lee](https://joonyoung-cv.github.io/), and [Alexander Schwing](https://www.alexander-schwing.de/) from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Adobe (CVPR 2024, Highlight).

## Enhanced Features

CutieStudio extends the original Cutie framework with:

- **Advanced Mask Analysis**
  - Frame-by-frame mask metrics (area, perimeter, circularity, orientation)
  - Object centroid tracking
  - Bounding box measurements
  - Custom object naming support

- **Pairwise Object Metrics**
  - Inter-object distance calculations
  - Overlap ratio analysis
  - Contact length measurements
  - Configurable metric selection

- **Enhanced Visualization**
  - Object visibility controls
  - Selective object tracking
  - Combined mask visualization
  - Soft mask handling

- **Improved Export Capabilities**
  - CSV export for mask metrics
  - NPZ format for pairwise metrics
  - Binary mask export
  - Enhanced video export options

## Installation

Tested on Ubuntu only.

**Prerequisite:**
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+ and corresponding torchvision

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/panyuxin1993/CutieStudio.git
```

**Install with pip:**
```bash
cd CutieStudio
pip install -e .
```

**Download the pretrained models:**
```python
python cutie/utils/download_models.py
```

## Specialized Models

In addition to the default models, we provide specialized fine-tuned models for specific use cases:

### Rat Segmentation Model
A fine-tuned model specifically optimized for rat behavior analysis and tracking. This model has been trained on extensive rat video datasets and provides enhanced accuracy for rodent tracking applications.

To access the rat segmentation model, please email panyuxin1993@gmail.com with:
- Your name and affiliation
- Brief description of your intended use
- Any specific requirements or constraints

We'll provide the model weights and setup instructions upon request.

## Quick Start

### Interactive GUI

Start the interactive GUI with:
```bash
python interactive_gui.py --video ./examples/example.mp4 --num_objects 2 --name_objects head left_hand
```
